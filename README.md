# CheeseProfitCalculator
A C++ program that calculates the production cost, profit, and containers needed to hold a given amount of cheese.
(A programming problem from my C++ course).

The user enters the number of kilograms of cheese produced. The program displays the number of containers needed, their production cost, and profit in the console.
